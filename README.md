# Run

A universal utility for running programs

## Usage

```text
run filename.ext
```

Run the program `filename.ext` using the rule `ext`, which is specified in `rules/ext`.

```text
run -rule filename.ext
```

Run the program `filename.ext` using the rule `rule`.

```text
run clean
```

Delete any compiled object generated by `run` in the current directory.

## Rule Specification

All rules are specified in files located in the `rules` directory. Each rule is a series of commands, one per line. The type of command is determined by the first character in the line.

| First character | Significance |
|-----|------------------------|
| `!` | The rest of that line is executed as a bash command. |
| `>` | It will mark the file following it as a compiled object. Following on the same line is the list of prerestiquites for that object. The following block of lines specify how to compile that object. If compilation fails, that object is deleted, even if it already exists. |
| `?` | The next block is only executed if the following file exists. |
| `$` | The line ends a block. |
| `#` | The line is a comment. |

The character `@` is replaced with `filename` (absolute path not including `.ext`) wherever it is found in the rule file.
